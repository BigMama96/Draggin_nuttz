Dragon Ball is a really, really long running series with lots of characters. Naturally, those characters end up getting VERY fond of eachother and kids are born, y'know to progress the plot. Here, me and Joanna are going to go through each of the main character's (Goku and Vegeta's) kids and rank them based on power to see who is the best one.
